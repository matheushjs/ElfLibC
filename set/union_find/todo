Make a set that also contains a hashTable
While handling elements which are integers, each integer maps to a void* stored in the hashTable
Each void* can be accessed through the hashTable by calling a generic function hashing( void* ),
  which should be given to the ElfSet constructor function

For this, though, we need a hashtable TAD.
